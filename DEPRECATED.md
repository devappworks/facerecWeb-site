# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Repository Archived

**This repository has been merged into the main Photolytics monorepo.**

## New Location

All code from this repository is now maintained at:

### Migration Details

- **Frontend code** (React Training UI): [`/frontend`](https://github.com/devappworks/photolytics/tree/master/frontend)

## Why the Change?

We consolidated the Photolytics ecosystem into a single monorepo to:
- Simplify development workflow
- Enable atomic commits across frontend/backend
- Reduce repository management overhead
- Improve code discoverability

## What Should I Do?

1. **Clone the new monorepo**: `git clone git@github.com:devappworks/photolytics.git`
